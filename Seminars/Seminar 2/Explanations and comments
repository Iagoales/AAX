First of all we start by loading the data and seeing its size, then we plotted the skelleton points and after that we plot the average ampplitude and the average amplitude by the subcarrer, where we can observate that when the subcarrer index is 10 or 15 the amplitude tends to do higher.

Then for defining our SVM  on our first attempt we had a pretty low accuracy so we decided to improve it so then after hyperparameter tuning, it evaluates performance using cross-validation, providing detailed metrics and visualizations. The system helps recognize human postures through WiFi signal patterns without cameras or sensors.

The implemented methods enhance pose classification through smart preprocessing and model optimization. Standardization ensures features contribute equally, while SelectKBest reduces noise by selecting the most relevant WiFi signals. SMOTE mitigates class imbalance, 
improving detection of rare poses. Hyperparameter tuning tailors the SVM for optimal decision boundaries, and cross-validation prevents overfitting.
Additionally, PCA (Principal Component Analysis)—though not in the current code—could further improve performance by compressing features while preserving variance. It reduces dimensionality, speeds up training, and eliminates multicollinearity, making the model more 
efficient. Combined with confusion matrices and visualization tools, these techniques ensure reliable, interpretable results.


The SVM model achieved 85% test accuracy with well-balanced precision and recall across five pose classes. PCA reduced features from 270 to 33 while preserving 95% variance, improving efficiency. Cross-validation (88.85%) confirmed strong generalization, though Class 
2 (F1=0.82) and Class 3 (F1=0.81) showed minor confusion. The optimal RBF kernel with C=100 effectively learned WiFi signal patterns. While performance is robust, targeted improvements for confused classes—such as feature engineering or additional data—could further 
enhance results. Overall, the model demonstrates reliable pose recognition.
